## Total Fresh Water (TFW) Forcing estimated from ISMIP6
This is a repo to track the computation, QC and visualization of a new estimate of TFW forcing that will include the floating ice component. This will be computed using the the raw-ISMIP6 data archive. PostProcessed data will be used with GISS-ModelE. 

*Note* Currently, this repository is structured with `mat` and `jupyter` folders that serve as workspaces. After the data has been extracted and the new TFW estimate computed, the files in these folders will be cleaned.
